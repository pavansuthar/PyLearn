* Multiplication
/ Division (returns float which is number type, i.e 10 / 4 is 2.5)
// Floor division (returns integer version, i.e 10 / 4 is 2) 
% Modulus (remainder of x / y, i.e remainder of 10 % 4 is 2) | use divmod(a, b)
** Exponentation (power of) | can also use pow(x, y) instead of x ** y

round() (rounds a number with specific no of decimals, i.e round(5.666675678, 2) is 5.67)
divmod(a, b)
pow(x, y)

# Big int
'''
py has handly way of making big int's easier to read 4000000000 can be written as 4_000_000_000
